# OVERVIEW
This project aims to address historical and ,in time, even modern cryptographic algorithms and ciphers.

# PURPOSE
As for now this project's only purpose is education, and understanding how to develop scripts that can replicate what was used in the past and therefore get a better understanding of how ciphers work.

# HOW IT WORKS
Firstly creating the algorithm is key, thus when approaching a new cipher or encryption/hashing, the first step is to understand how it works and then after that creating a method to break it. 

# TRYING FOR YOURSELF
For now that is out of bounds, the scripts have no real complexity and you can easily take them and run them yourself to see what they do.
