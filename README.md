# Cryptographic Algorithms in Code

## ðŸ§© Overview
This project showcases the implementation of classical cryptographic algorithms as they serve as foundation for understanding modern cryptographic techniques.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- To **educate** and provide insight into how classical ciphers work.
- To demonstrate the **implementation** of these algorithms in code.

## ðŸ“œ Included Algorithms
1. **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher that shifts characters by a fixed number of positions.
2. **VigenÃ¨re Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword for encryption and decryption.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge.
- Familiarity with the concepts of encryption and decryption.

### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-algorithms.git
